Below is a base-64 encoded list of banned words (for public domains) in a JSON format.
Since I'm not sure of the rules on banned words, I'm just going to assume that I can't include them like this,
so if you want to see them, decode it first.

The program reads the string that starts with tilde, so if you want to add anything, make sure the new string starts with tilde.
To decode the string, remove the tilde and do `Buffer.from("BASE_64_STRING_HERE", "base64").toString("ascii");`
